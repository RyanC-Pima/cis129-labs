print("Normally when you throw a rock into the water, it makes a big splash before sinking to the bottom of said body of water.")
print("But for some reason when he throws it, it floats.")
print("Rocks with bodies of water don't just float, not unless there's something holding it up, but the water is clear and there's nothing there. ")
print("He bends down and grabs another rock, it's bigger than the last pebble he had thrown, and this time he knows he throws it harder.")
print("Like the previous stone, it floats, and no matter how much he squints his eyes and searches, there's nothing there.")
